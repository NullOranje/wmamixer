Wmamixer is a fork of wmsmixer and is an ALSA mixer dockapp for Window Maker.

The code for the ALSA part was taken and adapted from amixer and alsamixer 
programs from alsa-utils package.

Changes
-------

Changes with comparison with wmsmixer:

- ALSA instead of OSS. This is the real thing, using alsa-lib, not just
  emulation of OSS.
- Removed config file support, since it doesn't apply anymore

Limitations
-----------

1. Currently, wmamixer does not support switches and enum type of controls. 
Only volume is supported. Enum and switch based ALSA controls are simply 
ignored.

2. There are controls with really small limit range, for example here is 
control Beep (pc speaker in other words) which is represented by amixer like 
this:

    Simple mixer control 'Beep',0
    Capabilities: pvolume pvolume-joined pswitch pswitch-joined
    Playback channels: Mono
    Limits: Playback 0 - 3
    Mono: Playback 1 [33%] [-12.00dB] [on]

Under "Limits" section, there is a Playback capability with range 0 - 3. Using 
scrollwheel on such low ranges is somehow awkward. For that controls it's 
better to use clicking instead of scrolling.
